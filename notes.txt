#ActiveSupport::TestCase private methods

(from test/test_helper.rb)

Note: some of these methods use *pairs* of models: e.g., Picture and DirectoryPicture, Tag and FileTag.

TODO: Perhaps, to generalize these methods, change to define the pairs somewhere. So, it could be called, 'model_pairs'.

TODO: write, 'so you can do: myModel ...'

mock_directory_picture_bad_names - itself application-dependent
Perhaps, change: instead, parameterize the model, making it:
  def mock_model_bad_names(model,expected)
    model.expects(:find_bad_names).returns expected.sort.reverse
  end
Instead, invoke 'mock_model_bad_names(DirectoryPicture,expected)'.
sub:
  (none)

mock_directory_pictures - itself application-dependent
Perhaps, change: instead, parameterize the model, making it:
  def mock_model_simple(model,expected=:all)
    mock_model model, :name, expected
  end
Instead, invoke 'mock_model_simple(DirectoryPicture,expected)'.
sub:
  mock_model

mock_expected - itself application-dependent
Perhaps, change: rename to, 'mock_all_my_models_expected'.
Not show.
sub:
  application-dependent:
    mock_file_tags
    mock_directory_pictures
    mock_unpaired_names

mock_file_tag_bad_names - itself application-dependent
Instead, invoke 'mock_model_bad_names(FileTag,expected)'.
sub:
  (none)

mock_file_tags
Instead, invoke 'mock_model_simple(FileTag,expected)'.
sub:
  application-dependent:
    mock_model

mock_model - itself application-dependent (pairs only)
Perhaps, change, to use: 'model_pairs' (defined above).
Or, pass two models.
sub:
  (none)

mock_unpaired_names - itself application-dependent
Perhaps, change: instead, parameterize the model, making it:
  def mock_model_unpaired_names(model,expected)
    model.expects(:find_unpaired_names).at_least_once.returns(
        expected.sort.reverse)
  end
Instead, invoke 'mock_model_bad_names(DirectoryPicture,expected)'.
sub:
  (none)

model_names - good, as is
sub:
  (none)

see_output - good, as is
Note: required is, 'App.root'. Is this automatic, in Rails?
sub:
  (none)
So, in a test, whether controller or view, you can say:
  see_output
or
  see_output some_string
and the generated web page will be copied, complete, into the file, 'out/see-output'.

series - good, as is
sub:
  (none)
So you can say:
  series 'aaa', 3
and it will return
  %w[aaa aab aac]

try_code - good, as is
Note: change 'to_s' to 'join', for Ruby 1.9, since on Array.
sub:
  (none)
Possibly useful while experimenting at the Rails console, when unsure how something gets passed, whether as a local variable, or an instance variable.
TODO: Find out how really to do this.
So, if you say:
  class A < SomeTestClass
  a=1; @a=2; try_code 'a'; end; A.new
the console will print:
   a.inspect:1
  @a.inspect:2
or if you say:
  try_code 'bad_stuff'
it will print:
   bad_stuff.inspect:NameError: undefined local variable or method `a' for main:Object
        from...
  @bad_stuff.inspect:"nil"
